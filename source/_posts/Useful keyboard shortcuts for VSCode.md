## Introduction

After I have tried *VSCode with Vim mode extension*, I loved this IDE so much.

And VSCode has some useful features, such as keyboard shortcuts that improve my code writing efficiency. So I'm gonna share them here, and I'll keep updating this post when I know some other keyboard shortcuts which I preferred.

{% note warning %}
**Note** This post doesn't contain any keyboard shortcuts about *movement*. Because I only use vim command in this case(which maybe I will write another post later).

### Comment

- `Ctrl+/` to toggle line comment. (comment the current line by default)
- `Shift+Alt+A` to toggle block comment. (adds a block comment by default)

### Multi-Cursor

- `Ctrl+Alt+UpArrow` to add a new cursor **above**.
- `Ctr+Alt+DownArrow` to add a new cursor **below**.
- `Alt+Click` using the mouse to add a cursor anywhere.
- `Ctrl+Shift+L` Create cursors on all occurrences of a string; select one instance of a string e.g. `cursor` and press `Ctrl+Shift+L`. It'll add new cursors after every instance.
